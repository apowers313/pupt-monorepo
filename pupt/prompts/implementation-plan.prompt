<Prompt name="implementation-plan" description="Implementation Plan" tags={[]}>

  <Role preset="architect" extend expertise="test-driven development, modular design">
    You are a senior software architect creating detailed implementation plans that balance pragmatism with best practices, specializing in test-driven development and modular design.
  </Role>

  <Task>
    Create a comprehensive, phased implementation plan for the design specified in <Ask.File name="designFile" label="Design file:" />.
  </Task>

  <Constraints extend>
    - Analyze the design document completely before planning
    - Break implementation into logical phases
    - The first phase should be a MVP and subsiquent phases should add incremental features
      - For example, if the feature is a new HTML page, the first phase should implement the HTML page and then add features to it in future phases
    - Each phase must:
      - Deliver functionality in a way that the user can verify that the functionality works, beyond just running tests
      - Include specific test scenarios (unit and integration)
      - Build on previous phases without breaking them
      - Take roughly equal effort (1-3 days each)
    - For each phase specify:
      - Clear objectives and success criteria
      - Test files to create/modify with example test cases
      - Implementation files to create/modify
      - Dependencies on external libraries or earlier phases
      - User-facing verification steps
    - Identify opportunities for:
      - Code reuse and shared utilities
      - External libraries that solve common problems
      - Refactoring to reduce duplication
  </Constraints>

  <Format>
    Write the impleementation plan <Ask.ReviewFile name="planFile" label="Plan file:" />. Use this template for the implementation plan:

    ```markdown
    # Implementation Plan for [Feature Name]

    ## Overview
    [Brief summary of what will be built]

    ## Phase Breakdown

    ### Phase 1: [Foundation/Core Setup]
  </Format>

  <Task>
    [What this phase accomplishes]
    **Duration**: X days

    **Tests to Write First**:
    - `test/[filename].test.ts`: [Test description]
      ```typescript
      // Example test case
      ```

    **Implementation**:
    - `src/[filename].ts`: [What to implement]
      ```typescript
      // Key interfaces/structures
      ```

    **Dependencies**: 
    - External: [npm packages needed]
    - Internal: [files from previous phases]

    **Verification**:
    1. Run: `[specific command]`
    2. Expected output: [what user should see]

    ### Phase 2: [Feature Name]
    [Same structure as Phase 1]

    ## Common Utilities Needed
    - [Utility name]: [Purpose and where used]

    ## External Libraries Assessment
    - [Task]: Consider using [library] because [reason]

    ## Risk Mitigation
    - [Potential risk]: [Mitigation strategy]
    ```
  </Task>

  <Constraint>
    - Each phase must be independently testable
    - No phase should break existing functionality
    - Prefer proven libraries over custom implementations
    - Keep phases focused on single concerns
  </Constraint>

  <SuccessCriteria>
    <Criterion>Plan is clear enough for any developer to implement</Criterion>
    <Criterion>Phases have balanced complexity and effort</Criterion>
    <Criterion>All design requirements are addressed</Criterion>
    <Criterion>Test strategy ensures quality and maintainability</Criterion>
    <Criterion>Human reviewer can understand plan without reading code examples</Criterion>
  </SuccessCriteria>
