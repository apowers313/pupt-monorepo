  <Role>
    You are an expert prompt engineer and performance analyst specializing in identifying failure patterns in AI-assisted development workflows. You have deep expertise in prompt design principles, failure analysis, and evidence-based optimization. You will actively modify prompt files to implement improvements.
  </Role>

  <Task>
    Use the `pt review` command to analyze comprehensive usage data for AI prompts and DIRECTLY UPDATE prompt files to:
    1. Fix documented failure patterns by modifying existing prompt files
    2. Create new prompt files for repeated Ad Hoc usage patterns
    3. Implement all improvements immediately (git handles version control)
    Your analysis must be grounded in actual usage evidence, and you MUST modify files, not just make recommendations.
  </Task>

  <Constraint>
    1. **Run the review command**: Execute `pt review --format json > <Ask.Text name="reviewDataFile" label="Review data file path" default={"review.json"} />` to generate comprehensive usage data
    2. **Read the review data**: Load and analyze the JSON file containing:
       - Usage statistics with execution outcomes and timing
       - Active execution time (excluding user input wait time)
       - User input frequency and patterns
       - Environment correlations and timing patterns
       - User annotations with structured issue data
       - Output capture analysis with error indicators
       - Detected patterns with frequency and severity metrics
    3. **Analyze patterns with evidence**:
       - Focus on patterns with ≥3 occurrences (statistical significance)
       - Correlate failures with environmental factors
       - Extract specific evidence quotes from annotations
       - Calculate pattern impact (frequency × severity)
       - Identify repeated Ad Hoc prompt content/themes
       - Detect common prompt structures and workflows
       - Analyze execution timing patterns:
         * Prompts requiring excessive user input (high avg_user_inputs)
         * Prompts with high active time but many failures
         * Correlation between user input frequency and failure rates
    4. **Review ALL prompts for completeness and structure**:
       - Read every prompt file regardless of execution count
       - Check for proper prompt structure (Role, Objective, Requirements, etc.)
       - Verify all prompts have:
         * Clear role and context definition
         * Specific objective statement
         * Detailed requirements or steps
         * Success criteria
         * Appropriate constraints
       - Identify minimal or incomplete prompts (e.g., single-line prompts)
       - Flag prompts missing critical elements like verification steps
    5. **DIRECTLY UPDATE existing prompt files**:
       - Use the Edit tool to modify prompts with identified issues
       - For prompts with usage data: Every change must cite specific evidence
       - For prompts without usage data: Improve based on best practices
       - Address root causes, not symptoms
       - Preserve successful prompt elements
       - Add verification steps for all implementation prompts
       - Replace ambiguous terms with measurable criteria
       - Ensure all prompts follow consistent structure
       - Confirm each edit is successful before proceeding
    6. **CREATE new prompt files**:
       - Use the Write tool to create new prompts for repeated Ad Hoc patterns
       - Each new prompt must address ≥3 similar Ad Hoc uses
       - Include proper frontmatter (title, author, tags)
       - Base templates on common patterns found in Ad Hoc usage
       - Test that new prompts are discoverable with `pt list`
  </Constraint>

    ```
  </Format>

  <Section>
    ```
    Pattern: "verification_gap"
    Evidence: 12 annotations across 5 prompts mention "tests still failing after AI claimed success"
    Timing Analysis: Affected prompts average 3.2 user inputs (vs 0.8 for successful prompts)
    Root Cause: Prompts lack explicit verification requirements
    Fix: Add "After implementation, run 'npm test' and verify output shows '0 failing' before proceeding"
    Expected Impact: 85% reduction in verification-related partial failures, 60% reduction in user inputs
    ```

    ```
    Pattern: "incomplete_task" 
    Evidence: 8 annotations report "stopped at first error" with 15+ subsequent errors found
    Timing Analysis: Average 5.1 user inputs needed to complete (active time: 4500ms across multiple runs)
    Root Cause: Prompts use "fix the error" instead of "fix all errors"
    Fix: Replace with "Continue debugging and fixing ALL errors until none remain"
    Expected Impact: 70% reduction in incomplete task annotations, 80% faster completion
    ```

    ```
    New Prompt Opportunity: "Dependency Update Workflow"
    Evidence: 15 Ad Hoc prompts in past 30 days containing variations of "update dependencies" or "npm update"
    Common Pattern: Users repeatedly asking to update packages, check for breaking changes, and run tests
    Proposed Template: Standardized workflow for dependency updates with automated compatibility checks
    Expected Impact: Replace 80% of dependency-related Ad Hoc prompts with consistent workflow
    ```

    ```
    New Prompt Opportunity: "API Integration Testing"
    Evidence: 8 Ad Hoc prompts containing "test API", "mock endpoint", or "integration test"
    Common Pattern: Users creating similar API testing scenarios with slight variations
    Proposed Template: Parameterized API testing prompt with endpoint, auth, and payload variables
    Expected Impact: Reduce API testing prompt creation time from 5 minutes to 30 seconds
    ```
