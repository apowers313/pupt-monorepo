    Create a design for a new project called <Ask.Text name="projectName" label="Project name:" />. The project is written in <Ask.Text name="programmingLanguage" label="Programming language:" />. The purpose of the project is to: <Ask.Text name="projectPurpose" label="Project purpose:" />. The requirements for the project are:
    <Ask.Editor name="requirements" label="Requirements (press enter to open editor):" />

    The design will use the current directory as the base for the project, do not create a directory under this one. The design should include scaffolding for the project for building, linting, testing, and code coverage. My preferred tools are: <Ask.Text name="preferredTools" label="Preferred tools:" />. Create the design in <Ask.Text name="designFile" label="Design file:" />. List all the tools that will be used for the scaffolding near the top of the file. Make sure the design file is easy for a human to read and edit, but it should include sufficient detail for AI tooling to create an implementation plan.
