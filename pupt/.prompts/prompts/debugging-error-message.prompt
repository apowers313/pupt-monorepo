  <Role preset="engineer" expertise="error analysis, debugging, root cause identification, systematic problem-solving" />

  <Task>
    Diagnose and fix all errors that occur when <Ask.Text name="errorCondition" label="Error condition:" />.
  </Task>

  <Constraints extend>
    - First, reproduce the error condition exactly as described
    - Capture complete error output including stack traces
    - For multiple errors, create a prioritized list (fix blocking errors first)
    - For each error apply this debugging process:
      1. **Understand**: Read error message and stack trace completely
      2. **Locate**: Find exact file, line, and surrounding context
      3. **Analyze**: Determine what the code is trying to do vs. what's happening
      4. **Trace**: Follow data flow to find where things go wrong
      5. **Fix**: Address root cause, not symptoms
      6. **Verify**: Confirm this specific error is resolved
      7. **Test**: Ensure fix doesn't break other functionality
    - After all fixes, reproduce original condition to verify resolution
    - Document any assumptions or environmental dependencies
  </Constraints>

  <Format>
    ```markdown
    ## Error Analysis for: {inputs.errorCondition}

    ### Complete Error Output
    ```
    <Ask.Editor name="errorText" label="Error text (press enter to open editor):" />
    ```

    ### Error Inventory
    1. [Error Type]: [File:Line] - [Brief description]
    2. [Continue for all errors...]

    ### Root Cause Analysis

    #### Error 1: [Error type]
    - **Symptom**: [What's visibly wrong]
    - **Location**: [Specific file:line]
    - **Root Cause**: [Why it's happening]
    - **Code Context**: [Relevant code snippet]
    - **Fix Applied**: [Specific changes made]
    - **Verification**: [How confirmed it's fixed]

    ### Final Verification
    - Command run: [exact command]
    - Result: [success/failure]
    - All errors resolved: [yes/no]
    ```
  </Format>

  <Examples>
    <Example>
    ```
    Error 1: TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
    Location: src/user.js:42
    Root Cause: API returns null for deleted users, code assumes user always exists
    Fix: Added null check before accessing user.name
    Verification: Error no longer occurs, added test case for null user
    ```
    </Example>
  </Examples>

  <Constraint>
    - Fix root causes, not symptoms
    - Don't suppress errors with try-catch unless that's the correct solution
    - Preserve all intended functionality
    - Make focused changes that don't introduce new issues
  </Constraint>

  <SuccessCriteria>
    <Criterion>Original error condition no longer produces any errors</Criterion>
    <Criterion>All fixes address root causes</Criterion>
    <Criterion>No new errors introduced</Criterion>
    <Criterion>Clear documentation of what was wrong and how it was fixed</Criterion>
  </SuccessCriteria>
